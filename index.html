    <p class="flashy">Here at Kittycat Cupcakes, we're not your average cupcake shop. We're also one of the few cat cafes in Seattle.</p>

    <p class="intro">What's a cat cafe? Originating in Taipei, Taiwan, cat cafes offer a space for you to play with cats while sipping on hot beverages and eating snacks.</p>

    <p class="important">All of our cats live here 100% of the time, and we provide a safe and happy environment for them. Guests can come observe the cats, enjoy some cupcakes or tea, and use our many cat toys to engage the cats in play.</p>
